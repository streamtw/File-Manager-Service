# File Manager Service

This project provides the following features:

* Provides a nearly zero-configuration and dockerized service, to serve static assets like images, videos and other types of files.
* Stands as a sample codebase for [Laravel File Manager](https://github.com/UniSharp/laravel-filemanager) integration with Laravel + Vue (Both of them can be deployed separately).

## Requirements

* Docker
